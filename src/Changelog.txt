Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2021-12-7
  Features:
    - Tags! You can now tag describe block/tests with string tags, and whitelist/blacklist tags in test config. See wiki on GitHub for more details.
  Changes:
    - The default ticks_between_tests is now 1 instead of 0.
    - The test progress gui shows the current running test before the test wait period, not after. This should make the gui more up to date in the event of a long-test.
    - Small improvements to locale
    - The factorio-mod-linker tool has been moved to a separate npm package testorio-tools. Please update if you are using it.
  Bugfixes:
    - The test config window is now properly disabled after tests have already began running.
    - Internally, Testorio lib is now bundled into one lua file. This should fix problems relating to module name conflicts
